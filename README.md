Pytorch Overview

It is an open source library

Developed by META AI Research Group

The original Torch library was written in LUA

Later on this was written in Python whichbecomes(Python+torch= Pytorch) evolved into python based framework

Core Features of Pytorch

Tensor Computation : Provides support for multi-dimensional arrays(tensors)

GPU Accelerations : Optimized for GPU processing, enabling fast computations

Automatic Differentiation

Pytorch vs TensorFlow

Pytorch is python based and TensorFlow is also python based but has C++core

Ease of Use : Pytorch is more intuitive and easier for research and TensorFlow has steeper learning curve but better deployment tools

Deployment and Production : TensorFlow is more widely used in production

High level API - TensorFlow has Keras while Pytorch has high level torch.nn as high level API

Core Pytorch Modules

torch : The core module of tensor operations

torch.autograd : Handles automatic differentiation for gradient computation

torch.nn : Defines and constructs neural network

torch.onnx : Open Neural Network Exchange support for model

Pytorch Ecosystem

Huggingface transformers : Popular NLP models

Pytorch Geometric : Graph based learning model

FAST API - high level api for deep learning
